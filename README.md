# Dyuti
Dyuti means both light and beauty, so we are throwing light on inner beauty because every woman is beautiful. We aim to bridge the gap between women and the availability of healthcare facilities. Dyuti is an idea of a portal that helps all women irrespective of them belonging to rural or urban areas, get the appropriate help regarding menstruation which is still considered a taboo in most parts of India. The platform will mainly contain 4 features: <br>
A) It will work as a platform where anyone can get into contact with good gynaecologists or doctors around the country and get their doubts or inhibitions clarified along with contact details of nearby hospitals 
B) It will also have a forum wherein they can discuss their problems with other women and also share their experiences 
C) The portal will provide a platform for blogs, wherein the tabooed topics can be discussed so that more awareness is created 
D) The portal will allow NGOs to collab with us and provide basic amenities to the ones in need.
